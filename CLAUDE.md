# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run setup       # First-time: install deps, generate Prisma client, run migrations
npm run dev         # Dev server with Turbopack on http://localhost:3000
npm run build       # Production build
npm run lint        # ESLint
npm run test        # Vitest test suite
npx vitest run path/to/test.ts  # Run a single test file
npx prisma studio   # Browse database in GUI
npx prisma migrate dev --name <name>  # Create a new migration after schema changes
```

## Architecture

Feed is a local-first RSS/Atom reader. No auth, no cloud, no API keys. SQLite stores everything. Single-user, localhost only.

### Data Flow

```
Add feed URL -> POST /api/feeds -> server-side fetch RSS -> parse XML -> sanitize HTML -> store in SQLite
Read articles -> Server Components query Prisma -> render three-pane layout
Mutations (mark read/star) -> Server Actions -> update SQLite -> optimistic UI update
```

### Key Directories

- `src/app/` — Pages and API routes (App Router)
- `src/actions/` — Server Actions for mutations (feeds.ts, articles.ts)
- `src/components/` — React components organized by feature (layout/, sidebar/, articles/, reader/, ui/)
- `src/lib/` — Business logic (feed-parser, sanitize, prisma singleton, utils)
- `src/hooks/` — Custom React hooks (keyboard shortcuts)
- `prisma/` — Schema and migrations

### Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript 5 (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui (New York style), Lucide icons
- react-resizable-panels for three-pane layout
- Prisma 6 + SQLite (single file DB at prisma/dev.db)
- rss-parser for RSS/Atom parsing, isomorphic-dompurify for HTML sanitization
- date-fns for date formatting
- Vitest + React Testing Library

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Server Components by default** — only add `"use client"` when interactivity or hooks are needed
- **Server Actions for mutations** — prefer over API routes; API routes are for complex operations like feed fetching/parsing
- **Server-side feed fetching only** — never fetch RSS from client (CORS/security)
- **Full article content stored in SQLite** — reading is instant, no network request needed
- **No client state management library** — React Context for UI state, Server Components for data
- **All feed HTML sanitized with DOMPurify before rendering** — never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without prior sanitization

### Design

Dark-mode-first. CSS variables use oklch color space. See `globals.css` for the full token system. Light mode is secondary.

Three-pane resizable layout: sidebar (feeds, 240-280px) | article list (300-400px) | reading pane (remaining).

## Code Conventions

- Named exports (not default), except `page.tsx` as required by Next.js
- `cn()` utility (clsx + tailwind-merge) for conditional classes
- Props interfaces defined in the same file as the component
- No prop drilling beyond 2 levels — use Context or Server Components
- Prisma client singleton in `lib/prisma.ts`
